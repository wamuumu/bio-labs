# Notes

## Exercise 1

### _Do the same EA parameters that you used for ``Or`` work for ``And`` as well? If not, modify them until you are able to solve ``And``._

### _Can you solve it? If you are unable to solve it, why is that?_

### _Does this allow you to solve the problem? What if you change this value to 2 or more?_

### _How many hidden nodes are required to solve this problem? Can you provide an explanation for why that is the case?_

## Exercise 2

### _Can you solve it? If you are unable to solve it, why is that?_

### _If you set ``recurrent`` to be ``True``, can you now evolve a successful network?_

### _Why might recurrence be important for solving a temporal problem such as this?_

### _Do the same EA parameters that solved ``Temporal Or`` also work for ``Temporal And``?_

### _Why, or why not?_

### _Are you able to find a successful network?_

### _If not, think back to what you just saw in the previous exercise. What combination of recurrence and no. of hidden nodes is needed to solve ``Temporal Xor`` and why is that?_

## Exercise 3

### _What do you observe? Is the algorithm without elitism able to converge to the optimal fitness value? What about the algorithm with elitism? What is the effect of elitism on convergence? What about the number of species and their dynamics?_

### _Change the parameter ``num_runs`` to $10$ or more. Does the boxplot confirm -in statistical terms- what you observed on a single run?_

## Exercise 4

### _What do you observe in this case when you execute a single run of each configuration? What is the effect of using hidden nodes in the initial population?_

### _What happens when you configure the script to execute multiple runs? Does the boxplot confirm -in statistical terms- what you observed on a single run?_

## Final questions

### _What is the genotype and what is the phenotype in the problems considered in this lab?_

### _Why are hidden nodes sometimes needed for a Neural Network to solve a given task? What is the defining feature of problems that networks without hidden nodes are unable to solve?_

### _Why are recurrent connections needed to solve certain problems? What is the defining feature of problems that networks without recurrent connections are unable to solve? Are there problems that require recurrent connections and multiple hidden nodes?_
